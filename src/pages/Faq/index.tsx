              <p>
                It is the first-of-its-kind atomic-swap based decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Liquid
                Network. It is a community-oriented, open-source solution that aims to become the framework for a fast
                and secure secondary market for Liquid Assets. TDEX facilitates liquidity generation in a way that
                leverages Bitcoin's security but mitigates its privacy and fungibility shortcomings, thus strengthening
                the foundation for Liquid Finance (LiFi)—the Liquid Network's version of Decentralised Finance (DeFi).

                <a href="https://www.blockstream.com/liquid/">The Liquid Network</a> is an Elements-based Bitcoin
                sidechain, developed by Blockstream. As a decentralised settlement network for traders and exchanges, it
                enables faster and truly confidential transactions in Bitcoin and Tether. Further, it facilitates the
                issuance of custom digital assets, a.k.a Issued Assets. A globally distributed Strong Federation secures
                and validates transactions on the network, thereby eliminating any single point of failure. To know

              <p>
                Atomic Swap is a decentralised, peer-to-peer method for exchanging crypto-assets without involving any
                third-party intermediary. This is an instantaneous process, with almost real-time settlement, and
                wherein the counterparties are in complete control.

              <p>
                Any transaction has two main elements—amount and asset type. Confidential Transaction (CT) is a method
                for hiding this information, despite proving to any verifier that the input and output values add up to
                zero. Developed by Gregory Maxwell, CTs leverage Pedersen Commitments to eliminate double-spending and
                other risks, while upholding privacy. To know more, read{' '}

              <h2>Who is a Liquidity Provider?</h2>
              <p>
                A Liquidity Provider (Provider) on TDEX is, basically, the equivalent of what is commonly known as a
                market maker. They provide liquidity to the exchange’s tradeable asset pairs by holding mutually-pegged
                pairs comprising a Quote Asset and a Base Asset. This applies to any asset pair and not necessarily the
                bitcoin-pegged ones. TDEX incentivizes Providers to run always-on endpoints, which substantially
                resolves the problem of{' '}
                <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095622703">
                  Double Coincidence of Wants
                </a>
                . The primary role of Provides on TDEX is to ensure that traders have readily available markets, which
                has been a consistent pain point for most DEXs. Traders, in turn, can discover Providers using the TDEX
                App or any other end-point based on the TDEX SDK.

                Forgetting your PIN is not a very big issue, as long as you remember your mnemonic. If you can’t log in
                to your wallet using the PIN, you can restore it using the mnemonic.

              <p>
                Sorry for your loss, but there’s no way to retrieve your mnemonic if you lose it. TDEX doesn't have
                access to your mnemonic and can’t help you in this case. Ideally, it’s advisable to write your mnemonic
                down and store it safely. However, if you do remember your PIN, you can use it to login and retrieve
                your mnemonic from the wallet’s settings menu.

                Never delete your App before deleting the mnemonic if you want to wipe out and reinstall fresh. So,
                before deleting your app you need hit Settings menu &#62; Account &#62; Delete mnemonic. Now you can
                delete your App and start fresh!

                Relax! You don't have to worry if your smartphone has been stolen, but the mnemonic phrase is not
                compromised. To regain access to your Liquid Assets, all you need to do is reinstall the TDEX app and
                the wallet on your new device. However, make sure that your mnemonic isn't stolen, because that is
                what’s ultimately required to access your assets, not just the physical device.

              <p>
                TDEX is a truly decentralized, open-source project with a dedicated community orientation. By design,
                the protocol doesn't charge any fees, in and of itself, at least. However, Liquidity Providers might
                charge a fee for the service that they offer, namely providing and maintaining liquidity for asset pairs
                so that you can perform swap-based trades.

              <p>
                To deposit BTC you need to perform a peg-in into the Liquid Network. You can perform a trustless peg-in
                into the network from our application.

                In case of incidents during the peg-in process (if you lose your device before full confirmation for
                example) it is possible to recover your funds by inputting your deposit address into the claim peg-in
                section of the application.

                To successfully peg-in BTC into Liquid, 102 confirmations on the BTC blockchain are needed. It takes
                around a day for the peg-in to be completed. You can follow the process from the L-BTC section of the
                TDEX app.
