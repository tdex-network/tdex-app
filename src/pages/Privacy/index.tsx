                Every Individual should have an inalienable right to privacy. In a world where technology is
                increasingly used to identify, monitor and track users, TDEX App takes steps in the opposite direction.
                The TDEX app does not collect or share your information. That’s our policy in a nutshell.

              <h3>TDEX App Privacy Policy</h3>

              <h2>Information we don’t collect</h2>
              <p>
                TDEX App doesn’t store any identifying information about your device, such as your IP address or your
                user agents or your transactions. TDEX App is designed so that it doesn’t store any information. You
                don’t need a phone number, e-mail, or any information tied to your identity or your Liquid Assets to use
                the TDEX App. TDEX App is private by default.

              <h2>Information that are shared with TDEX App</h2>
              <p>
                If you use the TDEX App on your Android or iOS phone, Google or Apple might store information about how
                you use the app. They can record when the app is closed, opened, how long you use it for, crash logs,
                and your device model. This usage information could also be associated with your Google or Apple
                account. The only information that TDEX App receives is the number of downloads and crashes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re planning to use TDEX App on mobile, it’s worth reading Apple or Google’s privacy policies. If
                you’re using iOS, check out Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines. For Android, read the User Data section
                of Google’s Developer Policy Center. Also, If you download TDEX app and install it manually with the apk
                from TDEX GitHub repository check GitHub Privacy Statement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, TDEX relies on Blockstream.info/liquid as the data source of Liquid Blockchain by default,
                but you can change from Settings &#62; Electrum server. For FIAT amounts conversion it relies on
                CoinGecko public APIs. Also TDEX App has no influence and/or awareness of if and how TDEX Liquidity
                Providers collect or use data related to atomic swap transactions.
