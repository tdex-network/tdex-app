            TDEX application (hereinafter referred to as the “App”) is a reference application of the TEDX.Network open
            source project (https://github.com/TDex-network/whitepaper). The App allows users to access the TDEX
            protocol and might serve as a non-custodial wallet for any Liquid Asset (https://blockstream.com/liquid/).
          </li>
          <li>
            The App may be downloaded on any available store or on Github at the following link:{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/TDex-network">https://github.com/TDex-network</a>. The App is provided on an “as
            is” and “as available” basis without any representation or warranty of any kind, whether express or implied,
            to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws. Specifically, the Company disclaims any implied
            warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement.
          </li>
          <li>
            By downloading and installing the App users shall have access to the following functions:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                generate a PIN (Personal identification Number) and the mnemonic phrase (the list of words that store
                all the information needed for the recovery of your wallet) for your non custodial wallet;
              </li>
              <li>receive and send any Liquid Asset;</li>
              <li>
                access and connect to TDEX.network for the swap of any Liquid Asset with other Liquid Assets considering
                the pairs offered by any Liquidity provider on the TDEX.network.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Users acknowledge that:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>The Company does not store or have access to their mnemonic phrase, PIN or private keys.</li>
              <li>
                It is therefore their responsibility to carefully guard the mnemonic phrase and PINs and to have a
                backup of the private keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a User forgets or loses his means of authentication the Company has no way to recover them and the
                user may permanently lose access to any Assets stored in the wallet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Therefore the Company has no responsibility and will not be liable for any loss or damage a User may
                suffer from the loss or misappropriation of his mnemonic phrase, PINs and private keys.
